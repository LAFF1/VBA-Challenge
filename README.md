VBA Challenge Results


Thanks for running my amazing stock calculator!

When run against daily trade values it will give you a summary by Ticker of the total change from the earliest date in the sheet to the latest date in both dollars and percent and a total of the volume of trading for the entire period. 
Looking for the greatest? We've got those too,  it also determines the biggest winners, biggest losers and the highest volume traded for the period. When it is done crunching the numbers it will also do some formatting for easy viewing. Winners in green and losers in red! It will also resize the columns for easy viewing.
